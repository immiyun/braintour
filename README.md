# Brain Tour

## Challenge
> Create a space where you feel like you feel like you're on an adventure. We get deep and personal in this brain tour inspired by the Tour of My Brain video made by AmazingPhil. Explore the different parts of my brain that make me me.

## Solution
> I loved reading Choose Your Own Adventure books as a child and liked the flow of the book. I brought the concept of those books into this website. From the homepage, you get to decide the path you take while learning about me.
